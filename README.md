## Description

Our goal of the project was to try and make the website both accessible and efficient in code:

- Our motivation was to try and make the Horiseon website accessible to those who can not view the website and are using screen readers or other assistive technology.
- I built this project to make sure that the website was able to be interpreted by all viewers. 
- I made it a lot more accessible by shortening css code and adding alt tags to all the images
- I learned that this is a critical part in website design to make sure the webpage is not just catering to a certain group of people
